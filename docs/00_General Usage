VisualARQ Python API Documentation
Version: VisualARQ 3 in Rhino 7/8


Notes: All methods are static in VisualARQ.Script. Guids are often used for IDs. Test in Rhino's EditPythonScript or Grasshopper Python component. Import: import VisualARQ.Script as va. From System import Guid; use Guid.Empty for checks. Materials: Use Rhino's rs.AddMaterial() and indices for assignments. Error Handling: Wrap calls in try/except for type mismatches. Many setters return Boolean (success/failure). Profiles are shared across objects like beams, columns, railings, openings. Opening methods are shared between doors and windows. For a complete list of methods, see the initial dir(va) output.
